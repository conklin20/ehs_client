# React Sample Code

### This repo is intended only for Civitas Learning's purposes.
This is the Front-End React App code for a project I am doing on the side (wrapping up soon). I have not included any of the Server side .Net Core REST Web API Code as that is not something I can share at the moment.

You obviously will not be able to pull this down and run it, as it is dependant upon the Back-end Web API. I will also send over some screenshots of the Web App so you can get an idea of what the React App actually looks like.

I'll also note that I am still finishing up this project, and there is quite a bit of cleanup I have planned (not all React components are named with the .jsx extension, which annoys me).
