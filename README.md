# React Sample Code

### This repo is intended only to be a code sample, for view only purposes.
This is the Front-End React App code for a project I am doing on the side (wrapping up soon). I have not included any of the Server side .Net Core REST Web API Code as that is not something I can share at the moment. This is also a slightly outdated version as I've had other commits to my main Repo on Azure DevOps.

You obviously will not be able to pull this down and run it, as it is dependant upon the Back-end Web API. I will also send over some screenshots of the Web App so you can get an idea of what the React App actually looks like.

I'll also note that I am still finishing up this project, and there is quite a bit of cleanup I have planned (not all React components are named with the .jsx extension, which annoys me).
